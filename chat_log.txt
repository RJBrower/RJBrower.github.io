Checkers
#claude
- Create a simple html page with an embedded javascript based game of checkers
- That's great. But I should not be able to move two spaces on my first turn. And I should be able to jump over multiple pieces if I can.
- Great! Now when no more moves are available, erase the board and congratulate the winning color and give the option to start a new game

Adventure
#Copilot
- give me an html page for choosing a direction to go (in a car). It's for an adventure! Also add a random distance between .1 miles and 5 miles.
- excellent start, but let's make it more dynamic with some javascript! I want to hit a button and it return the random distance and direction.
