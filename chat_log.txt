Checkers
#claude
- Create a simple html page with an embedded javascript based game of checkers
- That's great. But I should not be able to move two spaces on my first turn. And I should be able to jump over multiple pieces if I can.
- Great! Now when no more moves are available, erase the board and congratulate the winning color and give the option to start a new game

Adventure
#Copilot
- give me an html page for choosing a direction to go (in a car). It's for an adventure! Also add a random distance between .1 miles and 5 miles.
- excellent start, but let's make it more dynamic with some javascript! I want to hit a button and it return the random distance and direction.
#claude
- We gave claude the existing code from Copilot.
- Add a feature that displays the travel path on a canvas.
- Get rid of compass directions and make it resize canvas as need to show the whole travel path.
- That's great. Now make it so the user is an arrow that has a specific heading. And make the directions relative to current heading.
- That's awesome. It's not respecting the turn exactly how I'd like. For example, if the direction turns right and the distance is 2.0 miles, then it should turn right and go forward that distance on the canvas.
