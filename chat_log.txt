#I created this
#Copilot
- give me a simple div in an html page that just shows the contents of a relative txt file
- I noticed that some websites, when you save and use a link on the home screen, will open up full screen like an app. How does that work? How could I incorporate that into my webpage?

Checkers
#claude
- Create a simple html page with an embedded javascript based game of checkers
- That's great. But I should not be able to move two spaces on my first turn. And I should be able to jump over multiple pieces if I can.
- Great! Now when no more moves are available, erase the board and congratulate the winning color and give the option to start a new game

Adventure
#Copilot
- give me an html page for choosing a direction to go (in a car). It's for an adventure! Also add a random distance between .1 miles and 5 miles.
- excellent start, but let's make it more dynamic with some javascript! I want to hit a button and it return the random distance and direction.
#claude
- We gave claude the existing code from Copilot.
- Add a feature that displays the travel path on a canvas.
- Get rid of compass directions and make it resize canvas as need to show the whole travel path.
- That's great. Now make it so the user is an arrow that has a specific heading. And make the directions relative to current heading.
- That's awesome. It's not respecting the turn exactly how I'd like. For example, if the direction turns right and the distance is 2.0 miles, then it should turn right and go forward that distance on the canvas.

Super Tic-Tac-Toe
# copilot (done from my phone, including commits)
- Do you know what super tik-tak-toe is?
- How about a 16 square variant?
- Add the option to win with a square or all four corners.
- Write this into a JavaScript based game embedded in HTML. Add in a reset button and buttons in each square for means of choosing.
- Add a button so show/hide the rules (hidden by default)
- Instead of an alert, just highlight the winning combination(s).


AI Checkers
# COPIED FROM Checkers
# Claude 3.7 SOnnet
- add an option for the player to add in AI assist

```
Key Features Added:
Game Mode Selection:

Human vs Human (original gameplay)
Human vs AI (play against the computer)
AI Difficulty Levels:

Easy: Makes random moves with slight preference for captures
Medium: Makes decent moves with some randomness
Hard: Always makes the best calculated move
Move Suggestion:

The "Suggest Move" button highlights the recommended move for the player
AI Decision-Making Logic:

Evaluates moves based on captures, king creation, advancement, and board position
Handles multi-jump sequences correctly
Shows a "thinking" indicator while the AI calculates its move
The AI uses a simple heuristic evaluation function that considers:

Captures (highest priority)
King creation opportunities
Board positioning
Advancement towards king row
This implementation provides a solid foundation that you can further enhance with more sophisticated AI algorithms if needed.
```

- We'd like this to connect dynamically to an AI for assistance during the game, both for playing against and for suggestion to help learn and get better?
 ``` These changes will provide educational feedback to help players understand what makes a move good or bad, which will help them improve their checkers strategy over time. ```
